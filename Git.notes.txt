# GIT notes
# notation:
# # means comment
# $ means line of code to type in
# [replace] means replace the words and brackets with what you want


# at the beginning, BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES, make sure to pull
$git pull --rebase

# to add a file  use the line below (replacing '[filename]' with the file you changed, or replace it with '*' to add all files in directory)
$git add [filename]

# to commit designated file(s) use this '-m' means message, '-a' means all (of uploading multiple files you can add seperate messages for each)
# $git commit -m "[message]"    # this command allows you to commit one fall not all
$git commit -m "[message]" -a

# the final step in making a change is pushing
$git push origin master


# NOTE: if you remove something from your directory it should also be removed on git
# Do NOT remove the 'README.md' file, something goes wrong if you do
# there are a lot more git commands and uses for git but these should all we need:
$git pull --rebase
$git add [filename]
$git commit -m "[message]" -a
$git push origin master
